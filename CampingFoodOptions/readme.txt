Supplies Needed Page - Results of what packing list needs to be, split by Cooler items, non cooler items, and non food items. 


Would like to add check boxes to the packing list page (SuppliesNeeded.php) so I can see what has been packed, and what is still missing. A clear all checkboxes would be nice too. The checkboxes don't do anything except show what has been packed.
