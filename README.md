# WebDev
This repository is for any public web development I do


## Current projects: 
1. **Dominion Randomizer**
  a. to include blacklist
  b. record what was played, who played, then remove the cards played from the selection. When those players play again, then the program will automatically filter those cards out, so eventually you play with every single card you own. 
2. Puerto Rico
  a. Randomizer app - for expansion
  b. Game setup instructions for how many of each item you need based on the number of players.
3. Screen scraping for investing data
4. Camping App
  a. Meal selection
  b. Packing list with check boxes
